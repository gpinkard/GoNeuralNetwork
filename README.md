## GoNeuralNetwork
#### Simple neural network implementation in Golang

A simple neural network implementation I am working on, written in Golang. *Currently not complete*. I'll add more to this readme when it is done, feel free to peek into main.go to get an idea of how to use it (main.go will be removed later). If you have actual need of a neural network, consider something else.

#### TODO
- More activation functions (currently only sigmoids), Momentum (AdaGrad, RMSProp, etc.), dropout, different layer types...
- Save neural network state to disk
- More concurency!
